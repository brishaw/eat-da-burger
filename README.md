## What is this repo or project?
Eat Da Burger is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## How does it work?
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

1. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

2. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

3. The app stores every burger in a database, whether it's devoured or not.

## Who will use this repo or project?
**Anyone** who enjoys creating custom burgers, devouring said burgers, or removing bad burgers from the menu.

## What is the goal of this project?
